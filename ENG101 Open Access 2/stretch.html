							<h3 id="what is stretch?">What Is Stretch</h3>	
<p> Stretch courses take an ENG 101 course and stretch it out across two quarters so that students have more time to practice writing and get feedback on their
	writing in low-risk spaces. Stretch courses cover the same learning outcomes and course material as a one quarter ENG 101. Stretching the 
	learning objectives of a one-quarter writing course across two quarters gives students extended and intensive practice in the types of 
	critical reading and writing they need to be successful students across the university. The philosophy behind this model is grounded 
	in the assumption that all students coming into the university are capable learners in possession of effective literacy skills; however, 
	some students need more direct instruction and time to practice critical reading and writing, using conventions for academic discourses, 
	and making the rhetorical moves required to compose in a variety of academic genres and contexts across disciplines. </p>
							<p>Stretch courses increase the overall face time students have with a writing instructor. Students can potentially 
								have the same instructor for 20-30 weeks. Stretch courses provide students an opportunity to 
								keep a class of students together through both quarters to enhance their collaborative learning. 
								Stretch courses create “cohorts” 
								that can enhance and increase “student engagement. Because stretch programs keep students and 
								instructors together, classes are able to build on content and skills from prior quarters and 
								achieve nearly seamless curricular alignment.” A large portion of the stretch model’s success 
								is dependent on providing students with more practice discussing, drafting, and revising their writing.</p>

							<h3 id="why is stretch important?">Why Is Stretch Important?</h3>
							<p>Stretch provides students with several important learning experiences. First, learning in stretch takes 
								place in a cohort. That means that you can take two quarters of first-year writing with the same 
								students and instructor and develop relationships that are conducive for learning and developing writiing ability.
								Students will have the opportunity to develop rapport and learning relationships with classmates and an instructor
								that are conducive to learning. Stretch also provides additional time to practice drafting, reading, and revising 
								like a writing in low-risk spaces. Stretch relies on a large percentage of writing to learn activities so that 
								students can take risks with their writing and not be afraid to write and to grow as a writer and student. Stretch 
							is design to 1) provide students with an experience that will build their confidence in themseleves as writers and learners, and
							2) stretch helps students develop a healthy relationship with writing. </p>
							
							
							<h3 id="what do we do?">What Do Students Do in Stretch Courses?</h3>
								<p>Students are required to complete at least four high-stakes writing assignments and to develop the
									writing processes that accompany those writing assignments. Students will also read a variety of sources
									and complete several writing assignments, drafts, and reading responses. Instructors teaching stretch
									courses should help students develop the capacity to do the following: </p>
								<ul>
								<li>Understand how the rhetorical situation (audience, exigence, constraints, arrangement, style, context, and rhetors) shapes discourse. </li>
								<li>Locate and cite appropriate evidence and use rhetorical knowledge and frames to build arguments with those sources.</li>
								<li>When critically reading, investigate the relationship between ideas, arguments, assumptions, inferences, and evidence. </li>
								<li>Consider how complex and varied sentence structures are used to develop personal and academic styles of writing. </li>
								<li>Write for a variety of audiences, contexts, and purposes with an understanding of rhetorical constraints and limitations. </li>
							<li>Practice writing with different modes and genres.</li>
								<li>Utilize a range of research methods and practices, including primary and secondary research, to investigate questions, concerns, and ideas. </li>
								<li>Practice planning, drafting, revising, arranging, peer-editing, and self-editing your writing. </li>
								<li>Practice usage, syntax, and other basics such as agreement, punctuation, and grammar in context. Avoid
									acontextual grammar practice. Include more contextual grammar activities using the students’ writing.</li>
								</ul>

      <h3 id="general requirements">General Requirement for Stretch</h3>
<p>All ENG 101A and 101B Courses Should Meet the Following Criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students will write at least 10,000 words total across both quarters; these words may include
  reflective and in-class writing, writing to learn activities, formal writing projects, multimodal
  and digital writing activities, and revised writing assignments and drafts.</li>
<li>Over two quarters, stretch students will read approximately 500-600 pages of writing appropriate
  to college proficiency level, including articles, essays, book chapters, and web and multimedia sources and their own writing and the writing from their classmates.</li>
<li>Students will complete at least four formal high-stakes writing projects across both quarters. </li>
<li>At least 60% of the course assignments should be revision-based assignments. </li>
<li>High-stakes assignments must include multiple drafts with numerous opportunities for students to
  revise and to get formative feedback. </li>
<li>Students will develop proficiency in written English and learn more about the writing process and how
  writing functions across disciplinary contexts.</li>
<li>Assignments, readings, and/or class activities will enable students to learn to use a variety of
  rhetorical principles including audience, context, style, arrangement, invention, incubation, and purpose
  to enhance the cogency and clarity of their writing. </li>
<li>Students will learn how to conduct research, examine different types of sources, and use appropriate
  documentation formats for their writing and multimodal projects. </li>
<li>Students will engage with multiple perspectives. </li>
</ul>

<p>Please make sure you understand your obligation to complete both ENG 101A and 101B to complete the requirements for general education and AWI.
  Students must earn a D- or better in ENG 101A in order to enroll in 101B. ENG 101A counts as 5 elective credits. 
	Students need to earn a C- to pass ENG 101B and earn 5 credits for AWI.
  101A and 101B are designed to be an introduction to college reading and writing. Students
  in the stretch program will have numerous opportunities for writing practice,
  feedback, and revision. Please remember that the completion of ENG 101B with a C- or better
  satisfies the general education AWI requirement for graduation.</p>
