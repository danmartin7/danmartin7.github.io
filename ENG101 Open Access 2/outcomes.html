							<h3 id="what is ENG 101?">What Is ENG 101</h3>
						<p>ENG 101 is built around five domains of writing knowledge (Anne Beaufort) professional writers pull from
						when writing for various rhetorical situations: </p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Rhetorical Knowledge</strong>: writers use their understanding of rhetorical situations (exigence, rhetors, audience, constraints, Kairos) and 
								the ability to read texts rhetorically to make important writing decisions.</li>
						<li><strong>Writing Process Knowledge</strong>: writers use their understanding of the writing process to plan, draft, revise, and edit their work. 
							Writing studies research continually demonstrates the value of process knowledge and how writers transfer it across contexts. </li>
						<li><strong>Genre Knowledge</strong>: writers rely on their experiences and knowledge of different genres and how they structure and 
							form content in different ways for different purposes and audiences. The different types of genres and forms you will encounter across courses , 
	contexts, and disciplines will be rhetorically situated in specific ways and require different writing processes. </li>
						<li><strong>Discourse Community Knowledge</strong>: writers rely on their understanding of standards and conventions when writing for certain communitities, purposes, and audiences.
						Students will encounter many different writing practices and literacies
	across courses, contexts, and disciplines that have been constructed for a specific group of people .</li>
						<li><strong>Content Knowledge</strong>: writers rely on an understanding of the field's knowledge to write for a community.
							Without an understanding of the knowledge making practices a community uses to write, members of a community will struggle to 
							write well and connect with the community.(Beaufort, p. 3). </li>
						</ul>
							<p>We followed the Statements and Principles for developing writing programs and curriculums from the Writing Program Administration, the National Center for Teaching English, the Conference of College Composition and Communication, and the Writing Across the Curriculum Administration. 
		Current research in writing studies proclaims that writing instruction and composition pedagogy should be teaching students how to transfer what 
		they learn and know about writing across disciplines and contexts so that they have the best chance to apply what they learn to the writing 
		they will do in and outside of the university. According to the Writing Program Administration (WPA) “Statement and Principles,” writing 
		courses should focus on teaching students’ rhetorical knowledge, critical thinking, writing process knowledge, knowledge of conventions 
		and genres across disciplines, and multimodal and multimedia literacies."</p>
							<h3 id="why is ENG 101 important?">Whay Is ENG 101 Important?</h3>
	<p>ENG 101 will provide you with a foundation of writing knowledge based on research and expertise so you can
		make insightful and coherent decisions about writing across contexts.
								Expectations for writing built on myth lead to frustrated students.
								The English department's Writing Program at CWU believes that knowing what writing is and does leads to better writing.
								Students need to develop writing knowledge 
								they can use as a travel guide for writing across disciplines.
						 Learning more about Beaufort’s domains for writing knowledge
						will expand your understanding of how writing functions across disciplines and contexts, how all writing is rhetorically situated, and how
		writers actually write for real communities and purposes. 
		The English department's ENG 101 curriculum meets all of the AWI learning outcomes, and our learning outcomes align with the research on
		teaching writing and best practices from the leaders in the field of writing studies. </p>

<p>We also relied on the Statements and Principles for developing writing programs and curriculums from the Writing Program Administration, the National Center for Teaching English, the Conference of College Composition and Communication, and the Writing Across the Curriculum Administration. Current research on teaching writing argues that writing instruction and composition pedagogy should provide students more practice in the following areas:

							<p>According to the Writing Principles from the WAC website <a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/resources/">Link</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Writing as rhetorical</strong>: Texts are dynamic and respond to the goals of the writer(s), goals of the reader(s), and
	the wider rhetorical context, which may include culture, language, genre conventions, and other texts. In order to
	write effectively, students need to think rhetorically, understanding that all aspects of writing—from voice, to
	organization, to stylistic conventions—are affected by the rhetorical situation. Practices that assist students
	in developing rhetorical thinking include: genre analysis (comparative analysis of multiple examples of a type
	of text), rhetorical analysis of a text (examining arguments in disciplinary texts to learn the rhetorical
	patterns of argument in a given discipline), and peer review.</li>

<li><strong>Learning to Write</strong>: Effective writers are those who have learned to write across a variety of rhetorical
	situations, for a variety of audiences, and for a variety of purposes. Learning-to-write assignments are
	often higher-stakes assignments that require the writer to write with attention to the conventions of a
	rhetorical context (i.e. within the genre and discourse conventions of a specific community) and to move
	through a multi-draft writing process. Learning-to-write (LTW) assignments include academic genres (i.e.
	research reports, argumentative essays, analyses, annotated bibliographies) as well as civic genres (i.e.
	letters to the editor, proposals, reviews, blogs).</li>

<li><strong>Writing as a mode of learning</strong>: Writing has long been recognized as enhancing the learning process. Writing
	makes thinking visible, allowing learners to reflect on their ideas. Further, writing facilitates connections
	between new information and learned information, and among areas of knowledge across multiple domains.
	In practice, writing-to-learn (WTL) activities are informal, ungraded, and designed to focus on a particular
	learning outcome. WTL activities include double-entry (or dialectic) journals, freewriting, observation journals,
	reading responses, online class blogs, and class wikis.</li>

<li><strong>Writing as a process</strong>: For high-stakes writing (writing that will be graded), the writing process is long and
	complex, with the writer revising in response to developing ideas, reader feedback, and a deeper understanding
	of the rhetorical situation. Scaffolding students’ writing processes often leads to student writing that displays
	an increase in the depth of thought, awareness of audience, and attention to style and editing. Practices that
	assist students in developing an effective writing process include: class discussion of writing as a process,
	peer review of early drafts, teacher feedback to early (ungraded) drafts, and the assignment of reflective
	cover letters turned in with final drafts that detail the writer’s process.</li>
							</ul>

<p>The English department at CWU uses the WPA framework for rhetorical and twenty-first-century skills for college success.
	“Based in current research in writing and writing pedagogy, the Framework was written and reviewed by two-
	and four-year college and high school writing faculty nationwide and is endorsed by the Council of Writing
	Program Administrators, the National Council of Teachers of English, and the National Writing Project.”</p>

<p>The CWU English department supports the development of our students' habits of mind and metacognition. A habit of mind refers to ways of approaching learning that are both 
	intellectual and practical and that will support students’ success in a variety of fields and disciplines. The Framework identifies eight habits of mind
	essential for success in college writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curiosity: the desire to know more about the world.</li>
<li>Openness: the willingness to consider new ways of being and thinking in the world.</li>
<li>Engagement: a sense of investment and involvement in learning.</li>
<li>Creativity: the ability to use novel approaches for generating, investigating, and representing ideas.</li>
<li>Persistence: the ability to sustain interest in and attention to short- and long-term projects.</li>
<li>Responsibility: the ability to take ownership of one’s actions and understand the consequences of those actions
for oneself and others.</li>
<li>Flexibility: the ability to adapt to situations, expectations, or demands.</li>
<li>Metacognition: the ability to reflect on one’s own thinking as well as on the individual and cultural
processes used to structure knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>This curriculum will also develop your metacognition. Eleonora Papaleontiou-Louca (2003) notes that metacognition: </p>

<ul>
<li>"encourage the student to ‘think aloud’</li>
<li>focus his/her attention on understanding the way she/he thinks and the problems she/he has to solve;</li>
<li>ask not only for the results, but also for the procedure of thought and the strategy followed;</li>
<li>teach strategies for overcoming difficulties;</li>
<li>place each subject among its relevant ones and find connections among them;</li>
<li>encourage the student to generate questions before, during and after the   elaboration of a subject;</li>
<li>help the student to perceive entities, connections, relations, similarities and differences;</li>
<li>enable the student to become aware of the criteria for assessment." </li>
</ul>
<p>You will practice metacognition throughout the quarter and your instructor will ask you to reflect on your learning throughout course. At the end of the term 
	you will create an ePortfolio and write a reflection memo about your learning experiences in the course. </p>
