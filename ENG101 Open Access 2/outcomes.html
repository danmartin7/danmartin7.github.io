							<h1>ENG 101 and The Stretch Program Learning Outcomes</h1>

							<p>This course is designed to provide you with writing knowledge that you can use to make decisions about writing across contexts.
								Yancey, Robertson, and Taczak (2013) insist that “students need a vocabulary for writing in order to
								articulate knowledge and ensure more successful transfer.” They explain that “Without such a language,
								students cannot easily describe individual writing tasks or similarities and differences across them;
								without such a language borders to these new worlds represented by new ways of writing and thinking too
								often remain closed” (p. 101). Expectations for writing built on writing myths lead to frustrated students.
								The CWU English Writing Program believes that knowing how to talk about writing leads to better writing.</p>

						<p>Students, writing teachers at different levels, and faculty across disciplines struggle to discuss writing because they are not using
						a shared language for writing. That is one of the biggest inhibitors for developing students’ writing abilities
						across contexts. Students need chances to develop their writing knowledge and spaces to use their
						own language to develop a theory of writing practice that works for them across disciplines.
						Yancey, Robertson, and Taczak (2014) reiterate that students need a kind of “travel guide” or “passport” to help
						them make sense of their writing situations. Everyone needs a language for discussing writing and
						to think through their writing problems. Many people lack a language to discuss writing or to explain how
						writing functions. Students need a travel guide or passport for discussing and making sense of writing situations across disciplines.
						This will allow writing Instructors to be more intentional and direct with their transfer goals. </p>

						<p>ENG 101 is built around five domains of knowledge that Anne Beaufort contends professional writers pull from
						when writing and then make sure to develop their writing studies metalanguage so they can reflect and transfer
						what they learn: </p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Rhetorical knowledge</strong>: rhetorical situation; rhetorical reading; terms (exigence, rhetors, audience, constraints, Kairos)</li>
						<li><strong>writing process knowledge</strong>: incubation to product; terms (drafting, revising, editing, situational
						variables, extensive and reflexive;</li>
						<li><strong>genre knowledge</strong>: terms (structure and form, audience); </li>
						<li><strong>discourse community knowledge</strong>: terms;</li>
						<li><strong>and content knowledge</strong>: ? (I will argue that transfer is more likely to occur if the content is also the
						knowledge domains (p. 3). </li>
						</ul>
						<p>Each of the first four domains should emphasize learning certain terms, a metalanguage about and for writing
						that can lead to more reflection and transfer. Research supports the need for students to have a better
						metalanguage for writing they can use to talk about writing in more comprehensive ways. Perhaps I could
						present on a more writing studies vocab curriculum. I suggest using Beaufort’s domains for writing knowledge
						or Wardle’s threshold concepts for writing knowledge as a frame for designing your first-year writing
						learning outcomes. This will give instructors more opportunities to introduce terms and students will most
						likely encounter more terms and multiple definitions and interpretations for the terms that will expand their
						understanding of the terms and therefore how writing functions across disciplines.</p>

<p>The ENG 101 curriculum meets all of the AWI learning outcomes. Our outcomes align with the research on
teaching writing and best practices. We followed the Statements and Principles for developing writing programs and curriculums from the Writing Program Administration, the National Center for Teaching English, the Conference of College Composition and Communication, and the Writing Across the Curriculum Administration. Current research on teaching writing argues that writing instruction and composition pedagogy should provide students more practice in the following areas:
<h3>Writing Knowledge Areas for ENG 101</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rhetorical Knowledge</strong>: Students need more work throughout the course with rhetoric and rhetorical situations and how writing is dependent on audience, context, constraints, purpose, and rhetors.
<li><strong>Writing Process Knowledge</strong>: Writing studies research continually demonstrates the value of process knowledge. Students need more attention to writing processes and to practice developing a writing process metalanguage to think about and discuss writing.
<li><strong>Genre Knowledge</strong>: Introduce students to the different types of genres and forms they will encounter across courses, contexts, and disciplines and explain how those genres require different writing processes and are rhetorically situated in specific ways.
<li><strong>Discourse Community Knowledge</strong>: Introduce students to the many different writing practices and literacies they will encounter across courses, contexts, and disciplines and discuss how those practices are rhetorically situated and require unique composing processes.
</ul>
							<p>According to the Writing Principles from the WAC website <a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/resources/">Link</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Writing as rhetorical</strong>: Texts are dynamic and respond to the goals of the writer(s), goals of the reader(s), and
	the wider rhetorical context, which may include culture, language, genre conventions, and other texts. In order to
	write effectively, students need to think rhetorically, understanding that all aspects of writing—from voice, to
	organization, to stylistic conventions—are affected by the rhetorical situation. Practices that assist students
	in developing rhetorical thinking include: genre analysis (comparative analysis of multiple examples of a type
	of text), rhetorical analysis of a text (examining arguments in disciplinary texts to learn the rhetorical
	patterns of argument in a given discipline), and peer review.</li>

<li><strong>Learning to Write</strong>: Effective writers are those who have learned to write across a variety of rhetorical
	situations, for a variety of audiences, and for a variety of purposes. Learning-to-write assignments are
	often higher-stakes assignments that require the writer to write with attention to the conventions of a
	rhetorical context (i.e. within the genre and discourse conventions of a specific community) and to move
	through a multi-draft writing process. Learning-to-write (LTW) assignments include academic genres (i.e.
	research reports, argumentative essays, analyses, annotated bibliographies) as well as civic genres (i.e.
	letters to the editor, proposals, reviews, blogs).</li>

<li><strong>Writing as a mode of learning</strong>: Writing has long been recognized as enhancing the learning process. Writing
	makes thinking visible, allowing learners to reflect on their ideas. Further, writing facilitates connections
	between new information and learned information, and among areas of knowledge across multiple domains.
	In practice, writing-to-learn (WTL) activities are informal, ungraded, and designed to focus on a particular
	learning outcome. WTL activities include double-entry (or dialectic) journals, freewriting, observation journals,
	reading responses, online class blogs, and class wikis.</li>

<li><strong>Writing as a process</strong>: For high-stakes writing (writing that will be graded), the writing process is long and
	complex, with the writer revising in response to developing ideas, reader feedback, and a deeper understanding
	of the rhetorical situation. Scaffolding students’ writing processes often leads to student writing that displays
	an increase in the depth of thought, awareness of audience, and attention to style and editing. Practices that
	assist students in developing an effective writing process include: class discussion of writing as a process,
	peer review of early drafts, teacher feedback to early (ungraded) drafts, and the assignment of reflective
	cover letters turned in with final drafts that detail the writer’s process.</li>
							</ul>

<p>The English department at CWU uses the WPA framework for rhetorical and twenty-first-century skills for college success.
	“Based in current research in writing and writing pedagogy, the Framework was written and reviewed by two-
	and four-year college and high school writing faculty nationwide and is endorsed by the Council of Writing
	Program Administrators, the National Council of Teachers of English, and the National Writing Project.”</p>

<p>The CWU English department supports the development of our students' habits of mind and metacognition. A habit of mind refers to ways of approaching learning that are both 
	intellectual and practical and that will support students’ success in a variety of fields and disciplines. The Framework identifies eight habits of mind
	essential for success in college writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curiosity – the desire to know more about the world.</li>
<li>Openness – the willingness to consider new ways of being and thinking in the world.</li>
<li>Engagement – a sense of investment and involvement in learning.</li>
<li>Creativity – the ability to use novel approaches for generating, investigating, and representing ideas.</li>
<li>Persistence – the ability to sustain interest in and attention to short- and long-term projects.</li>
<li>Responsibility – the ability to take ownership of one’s actions and understand the consequences of those actions
for oneself and others.</li>
<li>Flexibility – the ability to adapt to situations, expectations, or demands.</li>
<li>Metacognition – the ability to reflect on one’s own thinking as well as on the individual and cultural
processes used to structure knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>This curriculum will also develop a student's metacognition.</p>

<ul>
<li>encourage the student to ‘think aloud’</li>
<li>focus his/her attention on understanding the way she/he thinks and the problems she/he has to solve;</li>
<li>ask not only for the results, but also for the procedure of thought and the strategy followed;</li>
<li>teach strategies for overcoming difficulties;</li>
<li>place each subject among its relevant ones and find connections among them;</li>
<li>encourage the student to generate questions before, during and after the   elaboration of a subject;</li>
<li>help the student to perceive entities, connections, relations, similarities and differences;</li>
<li>enable the student to become aware of the criteria for assessment.</li>

</ul>
