							<h1>ENG 101 and The Stretch Program Learning Outcomes</h1>

							<p>This course is designed to provide you with writing knowledge that you can use to make decisions about writing across contexts.
								Yancey, Robertson, and Taczak (2013) insist that “students need a vocabulary for writing in order to
								articulate knowledge and ensure more successful transfer.” They explain that “Without such a language,
								students cannot easily describe individual writing tasks or similarities and differences across them;
								without such a language borders to these new worlds represented by new ways of writing and thinking too
								often remain closed” (p. 101). Expectations for writing built on writing myths lead to frustrated students.
								The CWU English Writing Program believes that knowing how to talk about writing leads to better writing.</p>

						<p>Students, writing teachers at different levels, and faculty across disciplines struggle to discuss writing because they are not using
						a shared language for writing. That is one of the biggest inhibitors for developing students’ writing abilities
						across contexts. Students need chances to develop their writing knowledge and spaces to use their
						own language to develop a theory of writing practice that works for them across disciplines.
						Yancey, Robertson, and Taczak (2014) reiterate that students need a kind of “travel guide” or “passport” to help
						them make sense of their writing situations. Everyone needs a language for discussing writing and
						to think through their writing problems. Many people lack a language to discuss writing or to explain how
						writing functions. Students need a travel guide or passport for discussing and making sense of writing situations across disciplines.
						This will allow writing Instructors to be more intentional and direct with their transfer goals. </p>

						<p>ENG 101 is built around five domains of knowledge that Anne Beaufort contends professional writers pull from
						when writing and then make sure to develop their writing studies metalanguage so they can reflect and transfer
						what they learn: </p>
						<ul>
						<li>Rhetorical knowledge: rhetorical situation; rhetorical reading; terms (exigence, rhetors, audience, constraints, Kairos)</li>
						<li>writing process knowledge: incubation to product; terms (drafting, revising, editing, situational
						variables, extensive and reflexive;</li>
						<li>genre knowledge: terms (structure and form, audience); </li>
						<li>discourse community knowledge: terms;</li>
						<li>and content knowledge: ? (I will argue that transfer is more likely to occur if the content is also the
						knowledge domains (p. 3). </li>
						</ul>
						<p>Each of the first four domains should emphasize learning certain terms, a metalanguage about and for writing
						that can lead to more reflection and transfer. Research supports the need for students to have a better
						metalanguage for writing they can use to talk about writing in more comprehensive ways. Perhaps I could
						present on a more writing studies vocab curriculum. I suggest using Beaufort’s domains for writing knowledge
						or Wardle’s threshold concepts for writing knowledge as a frame for designing your first-year writing
						learning outcomes. This will give instructors more opportunities to introduce terms and students will most
						likely encounter more terms and multiple definitions and interpretations for the terms that will expand their
						understanding of the terms and therefore how writing functions across disciplines.</p>

<p>The ENG 101 curriculum meets all of the AWI learning outcomes. Our outcomes now align with the research on
teaching writing and best practices. We followed the Statements and Principles for developing writing programs and curriculums from the Writing Program Administration (Links to an external site.), the National Center for Teaching English (Links to an external site.), the Conference of College Composition and Communication (Links to an external site.), and the Writing Across the Curriculum (Links to an external site.) Administration. Current research on teaching writing argues that writing instruction and composition pedagogy should provide students more practice in the following areas:
<h3>Writing Knowledge Areas for ENG 101</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rhetorical Knowledge: Students need more work throughout the course with rhetoric and rhetorical situations and how writing is dependent on audience, context, constraints, purpose, and rhetors.
<li>Writing Process Knowledge: Writing studies research continually demonstrates the value of process knowledge. Students need more attention to writing processes and to practice developing a writing process metalanguage to think about and discuss writing.
<li>Genre Knowledge: Introduce students to the different types of genres and forms they will encounter across courses, contexts, and disciplines and explain how those genres require different writing processes and are rhetorically situated in specific ways.
<li>Discourse Community Knowledge: Introduce students to the many different writing practices and literacies they will encounter across courses, contexts, and disciplines and discuss how those practices are rhetorically situated and require unique composing processes.
</ul>
<p>To learn more about the new learning outcomes and writing knowledge areas, please enroll in the ENG 101
Canvas Shell. I will send you an invite. You can review examples of course materials with sample
assignments and readings. We are developing an open-access textbook that directly connects to our
students at CWU and the learning outcomes. </p>

<p>According to the Writing Program Council, students should be focusing on developing specific knowledge sets.
	They contend that:</p>

<blockquote> Rhetorical knowledge is the ability to analyze contexts and audiences and then to act on that
	analysis in comprehending and creating texts.  Rhetorical knowledge is the basis of composing. Writers
	develop rhetorical knowledge by negotiating purpose, audience, context, and conventions as they compose a
	variety of texts for different situations. By the end of first-year composition, students should learn and
	use key rhetorical concepts through analyzing and composing a variety of texts. Gain experience reading and
	composing in several genres to understand how genre conventions shape and are shaped by readers’ and writers’
	practices and purposes. Develop facility in responding to a variety of situations and contexts calling for
	purposeful shifts in voice, tone, level of formality, design, medium, and/or structure. Understand and use a
	variety of technologies to address a range of audiences. Match the capacities of different environments (e.g.,
	print and electronic) to varying rhetorical situations. Faculty in all programs and departments can build on
	this preparation by helping students learn:
<ul>
	<br>
<li>The expectations of readers in their fields</li>
<li>The main features of genres in their fields</li>
<li>The main purposes of composing in their fields</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The WPA also contends that:</p>

<blockquote> When writers think critically about the materials they use—whether print texts, photographs,
	data sets, videos, or other materials—they separate assertion from evidence, evaluate sources and evidence,
	recognize and evaluate underlying assumptions, read across texts for connections and patterns, identify and
	evaluate chains of reasoning, and compose appropriately qualified and developed claims and generalizations.
	These practices are foundational for advanced academic writing. By the end of first-year composition, students
	should use composing and reading for inquiry, learning, critical thinking, and communicating in various rhetorical
	contexts. Read a diverse range of texts, attending especially to relationships between assertion and evidence,
	to patterns of organization, to the interplay between verbal and nonverbal elements, and to how these features
	function for different audiences and situations. Locate and evaluate (for credibility, sufficiency, accuracy,
	timeliness, bias and so on) primary and secondary research materials, including journal articles and essays, books,
	scholarly and professionally established and maintained databases or archives, and informal electronic networks and
	internet sources. Use strategies—such as interpretation, synthesis, response, critique, and design/redesign—to
	compose texts that integrate the writer's ideas with those from appropriate sources. Faculty in all programs and
	departments can build on this preparation by helping students learn:
<ul>
	<br>
<li>The kinds of critical thinking important in their disciplines</li>
	<li>The kinds of questions, problems, and evidence that define their disciplines</li>
<li>Strategies for reading a range of texts in their fields</li></ul></blockquote>

<p>The WPA also asserts that:</p>

<blockquote> “Writers use multiple strategies, or composing processes, to conceptualize, develop, and finalize projects.
Composing processes are seldom linear: a writer may research a topic before drafting, then conduct additional
research while revising or after consulting a colleague. Composing processes are also flexible: successful writers
can adapt their composing processes to different contexts and occasions. By the end of first-year composition,
students should develop a writing project through multiple drafts. Develop flexible strategies for reading, drafting,
reviewing, collaborating, revising, rewriting, rereading, and editing. Use composing processes and tools as a means
to discover and reconsider ideas. Experience the collaborative and social aspects of writing processes. Learn to
give and to act on productive feedback to works in progress. Adapt composing processes for a variety of technologies
and modalities. Reflect on the development of composing practices and how those practices influence their work.
Faculty in all programs and departments can build on this preparation by helping students learn:
<ul>
	<br>
<li>To employ the methods and technologies commonly used for research and communication within their fields</li>
<li>To develop projects using the characteristic processes of their fields</li>
<li>To review work-in-progress for the purpose of developing ideas before surface-level editing</li>
<li>	To participate effectively in collaborative processes typical of their field</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>The WPA also notes that:</p>

<blockquote> <p>Conventions are the formal rules and informal guidelines that define genres, and in so doing,
	shape readers’ and writers’ perceptions of correctness or appropriateness. Most obviously, conventions govern
	such things as mechanics, usage, spelling, and citation practices. But they also influence content, style,
	organization, graphics, and document design. Conventions arise from a history of use and facilitate reading
	by invoking common expectations between writers and readers. These expectations are not universal; they vary
	by genre (conventions for lab notebooks and discussion-board exchanges differ), by discipline (conventional
	moves in literature reviews in Psychology differ from those in English), and by occasion (meeting minutes and
	executive summaries use different registers).</p>

<p>A writer’s grasp of conventions in one context does not mean a firm grasp in another. Successful
	writers understand, analyze, and negotiate conventions for purpose, audience, and genre, understanding
	that genres evolve in response to changes in material conditions and composing technologies and attending
	carefully to emergent conventions. By the end of first-year composition, students should develop knowledge
	of linguistic structures, including grammar, punctuation, and spelling, through practice in composing and
	revising. Understand why genre conventions for structure, paragraphing, tone, and mechanics vary. Gain experience
	negotiating variations in genre conventions. Learn common formats and/or design features for different kinds of
	texts. Explore the concepts of intellectual property (such as fair use and copyright) that motivate documentation
	conventions. Practice applying citation conventions systematically in their own work. Faculty in all programs and
	departments can build on this preparation by helping students learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reasons behind conventions of usage, specialized vocabulary, format, and citation systems in their
	fields or disciplines</li>
	<li>Strategies for controlling conventions in their fields or disciplines</li>
<li>Factors that influence the ways work is designed, documented, and disseminated in their fields</li>
<li>Ways to make informed decisions about intellectual property issues connected to common genres and modalities in their fields.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>Below is the WPA framework for rhetorical and twenty-first-century skills for college success.
	“Based in current research in writing and writing pedagogy, the Framework was written and reviewed by two-
	and four-year college and high school writing faculty nationwide and is endorsed by the Council of Writing
	Program Administrators, the National Council of Teachers of English, and the National Writing Project.”</p>

<p>Habits of mind refers to ways of approaching learning that are both intellectual and practical and that will
	support students’ success in a variety of fields and disciplines. The Framework identifies eight habits of mind
	essential for success in college writing:</p>

<li>Curiosity – the desire to know more about the world.</li>
<li>Openness – the willingness to consider new ways of being and thinking in the world.</li>
<li>Engagement – a sense of investment and involvement in learning.</li>
<li>Creativity – the ability to use novel approaches for generating, investigating, and representing ideas.</li>
<li>Persistence – the ability to sustain interest in and attention to short- and long-term projects.</li>
<li>Responsibility – the ability to take ownership of one’s actions and understand the consequences of those actions
for oneself and others.</li>
<li>Flexibility – the ability to adapt to situations, expectations, or demands.</li>
<li>Metacognition – the ability to reflect on one’s own thinking as well as on the individual and cultural
processes used to structure knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>“These experiences aim to develop students’ rhetorical knowledge, critical thinking, writing processes,
	knowledge of conventions, and the abilities to compose in multiple environments – from using traditional pen
	and paper to electronic technologies.”</p>

<p>According to the Writing Principles from the WAC website <a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/resources/">Link</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing as rhetorical: Texts are dynamic and respond to the goals of the writer(s), goals of the reader(s), and
	the wider rhetorical context, which may include culture, language, genre conventions, and other texts. In order to
	write effectively, students need to think rhetorically, understanding that all aspects of writing—from voice, to
	organization, to stylistic conventions—are affected by the rhetorical situation. Practices that assist students
	in developing rhetorical thinking include: genre analysis (comparative analysis of multiple examples of a type
	of text), rhetorical analysis of a text (examining arguments in disciplinary texts to learn the rhetorical
	patterns of argument in a given discipline), and peer review.</li>

<li>Learning to Write: Effective writers are those who have learned to write across a variety of rhetorical
	situations, for a variety of audiences, and for a variety of purposes. Learning-to-write assignments are
	often higher-stakes assignments that require the writer to write with attention to the conventions of a
	rhetorical context (i.e. within the genre and discourse conventions of a specific community) and to move
	through a multi-draft writing process. Learning-to-write (LTW) assignments include academic genres (i.e.
	research reports, argumentative essays, analyses, annotated bibliographies) as well as civic genres (i.e.
	letters to the editor, proposals, reviews, blogs).</li>

<li>Writing as a mode of learning: Writing has long been recognized as enhancing the learning process. Writing
	makes thinking visible, allowing learners to reflect on their ideas. Further, writing facilitates connections
	between new information and learned information, and among areas of knowledge across multiple domains.
	In practice, writing-to-learn (WTL) activities are informal, ungraded, and designed to focus on a particular
	learning outcome. WTL activities include double-entry (or dialectic) journals, freewriting, observation journals,
	reading responses, online class blogs, and class wikis.</li>

<li>Writing as a process: For high-stakes writing (writing that will be graded), the writing process is long and
	complex, with the writer revising in response to developing ideas, reader feedback, and a deeper understanding
	of the rhetorical situation. Scaffolding students’ writing processes often leads to student writing that displays
	an increase in the depth of thought, awareness of audience, and attention to style and editing. Practices that
	assist students in developing an effective writing process include: class discussion of writing as a process,
	peer review of early drafts, teacher feedback to early (ungraded) drafts, and the assignment of reflective
	cover letters turned in with final drafts that detail the writer’s process.</li>
</ul>
<p>This curriculum will also incorporate metacognition.
“The teacher who publicly demonstrates metacognition will probably produce students who metacogitate. One way
to make strategy thinking public is for the teacher to render the covert cognitive and metacognitive processes in
overt form by thinking aloud while modeling task completion. Some other indicators of teachers’ public metacognitive
behavior might be: sharing their planning, describing their goals and objectives and giving reasons for their actions;
seeking feedback and evaluation of their actions from others; admitting they do not know an answer but designing ways
 to produce one, and so on.” Papaleontiou-Louca, Eleonora. (2003). The concept and instruction of metacognition,
 Teacher Development, 7(1).</p>

<p>Metacognitive Abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>encourage the student to ‘think aloud’</li>
<li>focus his/her attention on understanding the way she/he thinks and the problems she/he has to solve;</li>
<li>ask not only for the results, but also for the procedure of thought and the strategy followed;</li>
<li>teach strategies for overcoming difficulties;</li>
<li>place each subject among its relevant ones and find connections among them;</li>
<li>encourage the student to generate questions before, during and after the   elaboration of a subject;</li>
<li>help the student to perceive entities, connections, relations, similarities and differences;</li>
<li>enable the student to become aware of the criteria for assessment.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Critical and Rhetorical Reading</h3>
  <p>Practicing analytical reading skills is a vital component of ENG 101A-B. Students
    will develop the capacity to do the following when reading critically: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Recognize the rhetorical situation for every reading: intended audience, exigence, constraints, main
  points of the argument or claim, and evidence used to support the argument. </li>
  <li>Be aware of the differences and similarities in academic discourses and genres and understand why
  those similarities and differences exist.</li>
<li>Develop the ability to annotate and summarize readings for main ideas and future use.</li>
  <li>Develop alternative reading and note-taking strategies.</li>
  </ul>

	<h3>Research Practices</h3>
  <p>Students should also practice a range of basic research practices in the Stretch Program.
  Specific instruction in online research methods will be particularly useful to students in stretch courses.
  Students should learn more about web-based research, digital writing environments, academic databases,
  the ethics of intellectual property, and the avoidance of plagiarism. We will be consulting with our
  university librarians to design an information literacy component for the stretch course curriculum.
  The following information literacy topics should be covered in ENG 101A-B and supported in the library: </p>
  <ul>
<li>Creating a research strategy and outline. </li>
<li>Locating research for various types of projects. </li>
  <li>Vetting and determining the appropriateness of resources. </li>
  <li>Critically assessing the credibility and validity of sources. </li>
<li>Vetting multimedia and digital sources.</li>
  <li>Using sources ethically. </li>
  </ul>
