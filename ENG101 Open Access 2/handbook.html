							<h3 id="sentences">Sentences</h3>

<p>Most people consider the paragraph the most important form of writing. But the sentence is where all paragraph, all writing, really begins. Creating 
							sentence is a rhetorical process.</p>

<h3 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h3>
<p>The formalization of the paragraph dates back to the mid 1800's when Alexander Bain identified several characteristics for paragraphs that we still follow today.
							Bain believed that all paragraphs singel a central idea and topic sentences. Conventions for creating 
							paragraphs exist to help writers organize ideas and thoughts and to help readers digest the writing.</p>

<h3 id="voice">Voice</h3>
<p>Voice </p>

<h3 id="point of view">Point of View</h3>
<p>Point of view is rhetorical. First, second, and third person present options for creating objectivity, subjectivity, and perspective. </p>

<h3 id="punctuation">Punctuation</h3>
<p>Punctuation is a rhetorical process. A handbook for grammar did not fall from the sky. People made these rules up and then imposed them on other people.
							Learning how to think about punctuation as a tool you use to create an effect on your writing is important.
							Punctuation isn't just a set of rules you learn and memorize and then mimic. Making decisions about punctuation
							should be about a purpose and objective. What are you trying to do with a sentence or paragraph and how does 
							punctuating that sentence or paragraph help you achieve that goal? </p>

							
							<h3 id="apacitationguide">APA Citation Style</h3>
							<p>Citation styles are rhetorical. Students often ask, "What's a works cited or reference page? Why do they matter?" I typically respond that it's the place where we get to see 
								all the intertextual pieces of other texts an author used to build a new text. It is textual DNA. It is important to understand that referencing and citing 
								is not just a cruel and unusual method for evaluating my writing? It's a way for scholars & researchers across the world to share information with each other because they can't meet and 
								discuss their ideas and research regularly. Yes, citation styles are very different, but each style has a rhetorical purpose. For example, why does APA start with the date?
								The sciences value the date of research. That doesn't mean that MLA doesn't value the date of research. Of course they do, but an article about localized cancer treatment from 1999 is not 
								going to provide the most current research on cancer treatment; however, an article about Shakespeare from 1900 might still be one of the best.
							Citations are about reading citations rhetorically, finding value in the source from the details in the citation. The title of an academic article actually means something. The title tells us about 
								the density of the content inside the text. For example, the article title "Combination gefitinib and methotrexate to treat ectopic pregnancy" tells me I need to back up and find a broader text to enter
								into the discussion. The title tells me I have no idea what is going on. That's knowledge. We're not dumb. We now know we need to back up and start with a broader article on this topic that we 
								can access and work our way to the denser articles. A works cited or reference page is about entry ways into conversations. We can use it to follow a trail of connected research. 
								Citations are a rhetorical pathway in the same way the title of the article tells us something about the accessibility of the information in that article.</p>

							<h3 id="quoting">Quoting and Paraphrasing</h3>
							<p>Quoting and paraphrasing source material are important and rhetorical. What you decide to quote or paraphrase depends on your purpose and audience. 
							One approach to quoting source material is to limit quotes to certain types of information. If you can summarize information in your own words, then you should summarize source material first.
							Reserve quotes for information that is difficult to summarize in your own words. Think about the types of information you might struggle to summarize. Statistics, definitions, and theoretical outlines might be
							types of information you might want to quote. </p>
							<p>Paraphrasing captures someone's ideas or words in ways that require acknowledgment. </p>
							<p>Here are some activities and readings on quoting and paraphrasing source materials: </p>

							<h3 id="summary">Summarizing</h3>
							<p>Summary is a primary writing genre for academia. You have most likely already noticed that a large portion of academic writing is summaries of 
							academic articles, books, and source materials. The ability to summarize source material concisely is important in academic communities to 1) demonstrate 
							an existing understanding of a body of knowledge and reading and 2) to avoid having to cite and quote multiple sources that are not necessarily central to the argument but
							are important to contextualize the writing and establish the purpose.</p>
