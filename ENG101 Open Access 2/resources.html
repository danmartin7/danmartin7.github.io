							<h1>ENG 101 Student Resources</h1>

<p>Research tells us that students in developmental courses need access to more than curriculum and
  instructional enhancements to succeed at the university. We know that students need access to several
  resources outside of the classroom. Below is a short list of resources students need more direct access
  to if we want them to thrive at CWU:</p>
  <ul>
<li>Writing Center: Students can locate additional resources and support at the writing center.</li>
<li>Library: Students can locate informational literacy resources.</li>
<li>Title IX Office: Students can contact Coordinator, Staci Sleigh-Layman at Staci@cwu.edu or at
  509-963-1256. Students can use the <a href="https://www.cwu.edu/hr/title-ix-cwu"target="_blank">CWU resource</a> "on sexual misconduct for
  students, faculty, staff, and visitors who are part of the Central Washington University community.”</li>
<li>Disability Services: Located at Hogue Hall, room 126. Contact information: 509-963-2214 and DS@cwu.edu.
  Students can find more information on its<a href="https://www.cwu.edu/disability-support/"target="_blank">website</a> where it states CWU is
  "committed to supporting and sustaining an inclusive campus that recognizes disability as diversity and
  ensuring that individuals with disabilities have an equal opportunity to fully participate
  in the educational process and university experience.”</li>
<li>Food Pantries: There are local areas that offer food services. Visit the
 <a href="http://www.apoyofoodbank.org/"target="_blank">APOYO Food Bank</a> website or go to 111 Peavine Rd, Ellensburg on Wednesdays from 6-7pm and Saturdays
from 1-2pm. Contact information: garrisop2001@yahoo.com and 509-925-1141.</li>
</ul>
