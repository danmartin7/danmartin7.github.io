							<h1>Revision</h1>

<p><b>By Kimberly Smith</b></p>
<p>In “The Maker’s Eye: Revising Your Own Manuscripts,” Donald Murray points out how many students
  believe that writing is done after their first draft is complete. However, more
  experienced writers tend to feel that the completion of a first draft is just the beginning of the writing process.
  Subsequent drafts are “opportunities to discover what they have to say and how best they can say it” (161). To
  improve a piece of writing, writers need to learn to read their writing with the
  detachment of a stranger (162). They need to be both critical and constructive.
  While different writers revise in different ways, they usually go through a few basic steps.
  Writers begin by looking at the big picture and focus in on the details as they revise (Murray 163).
  Writers consider the following aspects of writing when revising: information, meaning, audience, form, structure,
  development, dimension, and voice (Murray 163). For Murray, “A piece of writing is never finished” (165). While a deadline
  may necessitate that a piece of writing be turned in, there are always opportunities to keep revising.
  Writing is an ongoing process that doesn’t end after the first draft. Even professional
writers put a lot of time into revision to produce the polished texts students encounter in their classes.</p>
