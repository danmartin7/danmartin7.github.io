							<h1>Discourse Communities</h1>
                <p>In this unit, you will learn how to answer the following questions:</p>

                <ol>

                  <li><a href="#What are discourse communites?">What are discourse communities?</a></li>
                  <li>What does writing and communication look like inside different communities? </li>
									<li>Why is it important to learn how different communities function? </li>
                  <li>What are communities of practice and why are they important?</li>
                <li>What is an identity kit?</li>
                  <li>How do I write in different contexts for different audiences?</li>
									      <li>Examples of discourse community analysis assignments</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h3 id="What are discourse communities?">What are discourse communities?</h3>

              <p> In this unit, students will develop a comprehensive understanding of the how writing functions across
                disciplines and contexts and how genres and forms are rhetorically situated within those contexts and
                disciplines. </p>

<p>In “The Concept of Discourse Community” Jonathan Swales proposes the following six criteria for discourse communities:
	1) “A discourse community has a broadly agreed upon set of common public goals; 2) a discourse community
	has mechanisms of intercommunication among its members; 3) a
	discourse community uses it’s participatory mechanisms primarily to provide information and feedback; 4) A discourse
	community utilizes and hence possesses one or more genres in the communicative utterance of it’s aims; 5) In addition
	to owning genres, a discourse community has acquired a specific lexis; 6) and a discourse community has a threshold level
	of members with a suitable degree of relevant content and discoursal expertise.”</p>

<p>The WPA notes that:</p>
<p>"Conventions are the formal rules and informal guidelines that define genres, and in so doing,
	shape readers’ and writers’ perceptions of correctness or appropriateness. Most obviously, conventions govern
	such things as mechanics, usage, spelling, and citation practices. But they also influence content, style,
	organization, graphics, and document design. Conventions arise from a history of use and facilitate reading
	by invoking common expectations between writers and readers. These expectations are not universal; they vary
	by genre (conventions for lab notebooks and discussion-board exchanges differ), by discipline (conventional
	moves in literature reviews in Psychology differ from those in English), and by occasion (meeting minutes and
	executive summaries use different registers). A writer’s grasp of conventions in one context does not mean a firm grasp in another. Successful
	writers understand, analyze, and negotiate conventions for purpose, audience, and genre, understanding
	that genres evolve in response to changes in material conditions and composing technologies and attending
	carefully to emergent conventions. By the end of first-year composition, students should develop knowledge
	of linguistic structures, including grammar, punctuation, and spelling, through practice in composing and
	revising. Understand why genre conventions for structure, paragraphing, tone, and mechanics vary. Gain experience
	negotiating variations in genre conventions. Learn common formats and/or design features for different kinds of
	texts. Explore the concepts of intellectual property (such as fair use and copyright) that motivate documentation
	conventions. Practice applying citation conventions systematically in their own work. Faculty in all programs and
	departments can build on this preparation by helping students learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reasons behind conventions of usage, specialized vocabulary, format, and citation systems in their
	fields or disciplines</li>
	<li>Strategies for controlling conventions in their fields or disciplines</li>
<li>Factors that influence the ways work is designed, documented, and disseminated in their fields</li>
<li>Ways to make informed decisions about intellectual property issues connected to common genres and modalities in their fields.</li>
</ul>
