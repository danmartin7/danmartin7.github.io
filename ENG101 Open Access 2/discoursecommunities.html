							<h1>Writing Across Disciplines and Contexts</h1>
                <p>This webpage will provide an overview of how writing functions across
                disciplines and contexts and how genres and forms are rhetorically situated within those contexts and
                disciplines. This webpage will answer the following questions:</p>

                  <h3 id="What are discourse communities?">What Are Discourse Communities?</h3>

              <p> Discourse communities are everywhere. They are all around you. You belong to several discourse communities right now. 
		       Anis Bawarshi contends that a discourse community is "the social and rhetorical environment within which cognitive habits, goals, assumptions, and values are shared by 
		      participants who employ common discourse strategies for communicating and practicing these cognitive habits, goals, assumptions, and values” (p. 5).
		      Discourse communities create and rely "common discourse strategies for communicating" that don't transfer directly to other communities because 
		      discourse communities are highly specialized. David Russell (1992) contends that 
		      “writing is a complex and continuously developing response to a specialized, text-based, discourse community, highly embedded in the 
		      differentiated practices of that community” (p. 153). Jonathan Swales outlines those differentiated practices in
		     “The Concept of a Discourse Community” and proposes the following six criteria for discourse communities:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>“A discourse community has a broadly agreed upon set of common public goals; </li>
								<li>a discourse community
									has mechanisms of intercommunication among its members;</li> 
								<li>a
	discourse community uses it’s participatory mechanisms primarily to provide information and feedback;</li> 
								<li>A discourse
	community utilizes and hence possesses one or more genres in the communicative utterance of it’s aims;</li>
								<li>In addition
									to owning genres, a discourse community has acquired a specific lexis;</li>
								<li>and a discourse community has a threshold level
	of members with a suitable degree of relevant content and discoursal expertise.”</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Discourse communities have specific conventions for writing, speaking, and behaving that members are expected to learn. 
								These conventions establish a set of expectations for members of the discourse community.
							The Writing Program Adminstration further defines conventions and characteristics for discourse communities in 
								its statements about writing across contexts.
						 </p>

<p>The WPA notes that:</p>
<p>"Conventions are the formal rules and informal guidelines that define genres, and in so doing,
	shape readers’ and writers’ perceptions of correctness or appropriateness. Most obviously, conventions govern
	such things as mechanics, usage, spelling, and citation practices. But they also influence content, style,
	organization, graphics, and document design. Conventions arise from a history of use and facilitate reading
	by invoking common expectations between writers and readers. These expectations are not universal; they vary
	by genre (conventions for lab notebooks and discussion-board exchanges differ), by discipline (conventional
	moves in literature reviews in Psychology differ from those in English), and by occasion (meeting minutes and
	executive summaries use different registers). A writer’s grasp of conventions in one context does not mean a firm grasp in another. Successful
	writers understand, analyze, and negotiate conventions for purpose, audience, and genre, understanding
	that genres evolve in response to changes in material conditions and composing technologies and attending
	carefully to emergent conventions. By the end of first-year composition, students should develop knowledge
	of linguistic structures, including grammar, punctuation, and spelling, through practice in composing and
	revising. Understand why genre conventions for structure, paragraphing, tone, and mechanics vary. Gain experience
	negotiating variations in genre conventions. Learn common formats and/or design features for different kinds of
	texts. Explore the concepts of intellectual property (such as fair use and copyright) that motivate documentation
	conventions. Practice applying citation conventions systematically in their own work.</p>

<h3 id="What does writing and communication look like inside different communities?">What does writing and communication look like inside different communities?</h3>
							<p>Start to identify discourse communities you currently belong to now and note some the six characteristics for each community. 
								Explain how the community's characteristics work and function.</p>
							
							<h3 id="What are genres">What Are Genres?</h3>
							<p>"Genres are enacted by writers and readers" (Hart-Davidson) from <i>Naming What We Know: Threshold Concepts</i>.</p>
							<p>Anis Bawarshi asserts that “genres situate and help generate rhetorical and social activities” (p. 32) and 
								"that genres function as sites of action in which writers acquire, articulate, and potentially resist motives to act” (p. 45).
							She notes that “writers begin to write by locating themselves within rhetorical ecosystems we call genres. It is within genres that 
								writers invent themselves, their subjects, and their texts” (p. 103). Adam Banks argues that “Genres and the 
								discursive conventions that comprise them, can, through their privileging of certain kinds of knowledge and experience while 
								dismissing others, can become instruments, tools, technologies even, in maintaining established patterns of social, 
								political, and economic relations” (87). </p>
