							<h3 id="What is research">What Is Reserch</h3>
							<p>When you hear or see the word research, especially in school settings, you may be likely to 
							associate that word with science, labs, and research methods. However, research is much more expansive 
							and broader than bunsen burners and dissecting a frog. Taking pictures and screenshots are research. 
							Collecting data about your writing process is research.</p>
							
							<h3 id="What is primary research?">What Is Primary Research?</h3>
							<p>You've probably heard the term primary research right before or after you heard the term secondary 
							research. You probably wondered what the differences are between these two types of research. Primary 
							research is research you create or conduct. </p>
							
							<h3 id="What is secondary research?">What Is Secondary Research?</h3>
							<p></p>
							
							<p> What is qualitative research?</p>
							<p> What is quanatitative research?</p>
