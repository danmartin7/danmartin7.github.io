							<h3 id="What is research">What Is Research</h3>
							<p>When you hear or see the word research, especially in academic settings, you most likely 
							associate that word with the sciences, labs, and research methods. However, research is much more expansive 
							and broader than bunsen burners and dissecting a frog. Taking pictures and screenshots are research. 
							Collecting data about your writing process is research. Looking through old photographs, letters, and journals is research.</p>
							
							<p>Research decisions are always made for a reason and influenced by a specific set of factors. All research methods are rhetorical because we approach research and data collection in 
								specific ways that we think will allow us to say certain things for certain reasons. We select a method and approach to research because we think it will give 
								us the best chance of solving some particular issue that we have chosen to address for another set of rhetorical purposes.
							Porter and Sullivan argue that research is a “practical action” (p. 39) and that research comes with a “political and 
								ethical situatedness” (41) that must be transparent. Research is guided and negotiated by the context, researcher, and subject matter. 
								When we conduct research, we need to consider the kairos of the context, the audiences involved, and
								technologies being used. They contend that “The research process is a continual reshaping of its own picture vis-à-vis the picture in the researchers head” (p. 68).

							<h3 id="What is primary research?">What Is Primary Research?</h3>
							<p>You've probably heard the term primary research right before or after you heard the term secondary 
							research. You most likely wondered what the differences are between these two types of research. One form of primary 
							research is the research you create or conduct through interviews, surveys, observations, experiments, textual and discourse analysis. These are just some
								of the methods associated with primary research. When you think about primary and secondary research, try to remember that 
								primary research is a form of research that you conduct yourself. If you conduct an interview with an expert for a project, you will be conducting 
								primary research. If you published the interview for a journal article, it would become a secondary source that reports on your primary research. 
								Historians might rely on the examination
								and analysis of a set of primary documents for a primary research project. Examining a collection of newspapers from 1900 to answer a research 
								question about how newspapers structure content would make the newspapers a primary source material.

							<h3 id="What is qualitative research?">What Is Qualitative Research?</h3>
							<p>One form of primary research is qualitative research. You've most likley heard the terms qualitative and quantiative research before and wondered how they differ. Qualitative research includes
							methods of research that rely on interviews, case studies, observations, and surveys.</p>

							</ul>
							<h3 id="What is quanatitative research?">What Is Quantitative Research?</h3>
							<p>Another form of primary research is quantitative research. Quantitative Research is a type of research that focuses on 
								numbers and the quantification of data and information.</p>
							
							
							<h3 id="What is secondary research?">What Is Secondary Research?</h3>
							<p>Secondary research is the type of research you are most likely familiar with and use to conducting. This is a form of research you most likely learned about
								in secondary school at the library, locating sources (books, articles, magazines, etc.) and referencing content 
								from those sources to support a point or thesis in a paper. Locating someone's publication and
								citing it in your project is an example of secondary research.</p>
