							<h3 id="What is research">What Is Research</h3>
							<p>When you hear or see the word research, especially in academic settings, you most likely 
							associate that word with the sciences, labs, and research methods. However, research is much more expansive 
							and broader than bunsen burners and dissecting a frog. Taking pictures and screenshots are research. 
							Collecting data about your writing process is research. Looking through old photographs, letters, and journals is research.</p>
							
							<h3 id="What is primary research?">What Is Primary Research?</h3>
							<p>You've probably heard the term primary research right before or after you heard the term secondary 
							research. You most likely wondered what the differences are between these two types of research. One form of primary 
							research is the research you create or conduct through interviews, surveys, observations, experiments, textual and discourse analysis. These are just some
								of the methods associated with primary research. When you think about primary and secondary research, try to remember that 
								primary research is a form of research that you conduct yourself. If you conduct an interview with an expert for a project, you will be conducting 
								primary research. If you published the interview for a journal article, it would become a secondary source that reports on your primary research. 
								Historians might rely on the examination
								and analysis of a set of primary documents for a primary research project. Examining a collection of newspapers from 1900 to answer a research 
								question about how newspapers structure content would make the newspapers a primary source material.

	Observations, Surveys, and Interviews"</a> by Dana Lynn Driscoll</li>
								
							</ol>
							
							<h3 id="What is secondary research?">What Is Secondary Research?</h3>
							<p>Secondary research is the type of research you are most likely familiar with and use to conducting. This is a form of research you most likely learned about
								in secondary school at the library, locating sources (books, articles, magazines, etc.) and referencing content 
								from those sources to support a point or thesis in a paper. Locating someone's publication and
								citing it in your project is an example of secondary research.</p>
							
							<h3 id="What is qualitative research?">What Is Qualitative Research?</h3>
							<p>You've most likley heard the terms qualitative and quantiative research before and wondered how they differ. Qualitative research includes
							methods of research that rely on interviews, case studies, observations, and surveys.</p>
