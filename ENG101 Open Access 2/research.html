							<h3 id="What is research">What Is Research</h3>
							<p>When you hear or see the word research, especially in school settings, you may be likely to 
							associate that word with science, labs, and research methods. However, research is much more expansive 
							and broader than bunsen burners and dissecting a frog. Taking pictures and screenshots are research. 
							Collecting data about your writing process is research.</p>
							
							<h3 id="What is primary research?">What Is Primary Research?</h3>
							<p>You've probably heard the term primary research right before or after you heard the term secondary 
							research. You probably wondered what the differences are between these two types of research. Primary 
							research is research you create or conduct. Interviews, surveys, observations, experiments, and discourse analysis are just some
								of the methods associated with primary research. When you think about primary and secondary research, remember that 
								primary research is the research that you conduct yourself. If you were to conduct an interview with an expert for a project, you conducted 
								primary research. If you published the interview for a journal article, it will become a secondary source. Historian might rely on the examination
								and analysis of primary documents for a project. Examining a collection of newspapers from 1900 to answer a question about how newspapers structured 
								content would make the newspapers a primary source.
							</p>
							
							<h3 id="What is secondary research?">What Is Secondary Research?</h3>
							<p>Secondary research is the type of research you are most likely familiar with. This is the type of research you've done
								in secondary school at the library, locating sources (books, articles, magazines, etc.) and referencing content 
								from those sources to support a point or thesis in a paper. Locating someone's publication and
								citing it in your project is an example of secondary research.</p>
							
							<h3 id="What is qualitative research?">What Is Qualitative Research?</h3>
							<p>You've most likley heard the terms qualitative and quantiative research before and wondered how they differ. Qualitative research includes
							methods of research that rely on interviews, case studies, observations, and surveys.</p>
							
							<h3 od="What is quanatitative research?">What Is Quantitative Research?</h3>
