							<h3 id="what is feedback?">What Is Feedback</h3>	
<p> Feedback is a central component of writing and the course. 
Feedback is an effective tool for teaching and learning and an opportunity, probably our best opportunity, to discuss and learn more about
writing. Good writing is built around providing and receiving formative feedback. Learning how to provide and receive feedback on writing 
is part of the course content. Feedback should lead the writer to make revisions and keep learning. Feedback is more than 
a tool to justify a grade, praise or degrade student work, or lecture. 
Feedback is a teaching tool that can motivate or demotivate writers, and it provides an opportunity for learning from others and sharing ideas. 
Learning occurs in multiple places in a course, but feedback should account for a significant portion of the learning in a 
course. You will need to learning a vareity of feedback literacies and practices. Learning how to seek out feedback, where and when to seek out feedback, how to discard
and use feedback, how to avoid emotional overreaction to feedback, are all important feedback literacies needed to develop as a writer and a critical thinker.
</p>
	
							<h3 id="why is feedback important?">Why Is Feedback Important?</h3>
	<p>Feedback is another form of teaching and learning. In writing courses, feedback is perhaps one of the most important tools for teaching and learning.

							<h3 id="how do we give good feedback?">How Do We Give Good Feedback?</h3>
								<p> Summative and formative feedback are terms that are often used interchangeably but 
								they have very different meanings. Formative feedback can take many forms. 
								Providing feedback loops and questions gives you a chance to make revisions and modifications before turning in a final project. 
								Make sure you practice giving feedback helps someone move their learning forward, or “feed-forward” Parkin (2017). Feed-forward is feedback that 
								creates a space for someone to act on and to learn from the feedback. </p>
								
<h3 id="peer reviewing">What Is a Peer Review?</h3>
	<p>Peer review is an important part of the writing process. It is an opportunity to share your writing with other people who want to read it and 
							help provide the author feedback to make the piece stronger and more epistemic. In this course peer review
							will mean sharing a late stage draft with several classamates in a formal review process with guidelines 
							and structured questions to facilitate the peer review. In professional settings and contexts peer review is also a more 
							formal review of late stage writing that involves experts on the ideas presented in the writing and reviews them for accuracy and relevancy.</p>
