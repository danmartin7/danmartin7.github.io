<h3>The Washington Normal School (1891)</h3>
							<h3>Central Washington College of Education (1937)</h3>
							<h3>Central Washington State College (1961)</h3>
		<h3>Central Washington University (1977)</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>1889</strong>: Washington is admitted to the Union as a state on November 11th.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>1890</strong>: The Washington State Normal School at Ellensburg was established by an Act from the Legislature, approved March 28. The first legislature in 1890 enacted a law that read, ''There shall be established in the City of Ellensburg, County of Kittitas, a school for the training and education of teachers in the art of instructing and governing in the public schools of the State."&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>1891</strong>: The Washington State Normal School at Ellensburg opened on September 17. I've seen the 6th of September listed as an opening-date, too.&nbsp;<strong></strong></li>
    <li><strong>1892-93</strong>: There is no one listed for the English department or as faculty for teaching writing courses this year, but Elvira Marquis, an English teacher listed in upcoming years, is listed in the 1904-05 catalogue as a teacher at the Normal school from 1892-97.</li>
    <li><strong>1893</strong>: The main building for the school is completed. It's Barge now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>1893-94</strong>: Elvira Marquis is listed as the first faculty member for the English department at the Normal School.</li>
    <li><strong>1894-95</strong>: There is no catalogue covering these years at the Normal School. We can assume Marquis is teaching English courses this year.</li>
    <li><strong>1895-96</strong>: Elvira Marquis is listed as English faculty and as a secretary to the Principal for 1896-97.</li>
    <li><strong>1896-97</strong>: There is no catalogue for this year, but Marquis is listed for English in the 1895-96 catalogue for these years.</li>
    <li><strong>1897-98</strong>:<strong> </strong>There is no catalogue accounting for this year. We know Marquis retired in 1897, so it unlikely she taught courses in English this year or for the entire year. There is a transition in leadership taking place for writing and English during this year and the following year. It is unknown who exactly is teaching English or running the English department this year.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>1898-99</strong>: There is a faculty page in the catalogue but no one is listed for English for the 1899-1900 year. English is the only department missing a faculty page. This is probably the year Marquis left or retired from Washington State Normal School and someone else was brought in to takeover.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>1899-1900</strong>: Laura Grace Riddell is identified as faculty for the English Language, Literature department</li>
    <li><strong>1900-1901</strong>: Laura Grace Riddell is from Stanford. She is listed for faculty in English Literature and Language for this year, too.</li>
    <li><strong>1901-1902</strong>: Dr. Ella Isabel Harris takes over the English department. She has a PhD from Yale. She brings the Yale school theory to Washington. Riddell retires in 1902. It is noted in the 1910-11 catalogue that Riddell is in Forestry service in Portland, OR.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>1902-1903</strong>: Dr. Ella Isabel Harris is listed as faculty for the English department. Harris is still in charge of The English Language and Literature but there is an additional person this year, Bethesda I. Beals, Ph. B., who teaches Latin and English. This looks like the first hiring of an instructor to teach non literature courses.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>1903-1904</strong>: Dr. Ella Isabel Harris for Literature and Bethesda Beals for Latin and English.&nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong> 1904-1905</strong>: Dr. Ella Isabel Harris for The English Language, Literature and Bethesda Beals for Latin and English.
    </li>
    <li><strong>1905-1906</strong>
        :Dr. Ella Isabel Harris for The English Language, Literature and Bethesda Beals for Latin and English.
    </li>
    <li><strong>1906-1907</strong>: Dr. Ella Isabel Harris for The English Language, Literature and Bethesda Beals for Latin and English. An appropriation of $75,000 for additional buildings was made by the Tenth Legislature and approved March 15, 1907.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>1907 Quarterly</strong>: Dr. Ella Isabel Harris was an editor of this Quarterly. Beals
				retires and is replaced with Miss Alberta MacDonnell, A. B., a graduate of the Washington
				Normal School in the class of 1899, who since then has studied for two years at Vassar
				College, one year at Stanford University, and one year at the University of Michigan,
				graduating in 1906 from Michigan. It is noted in the 1910-11 catalogue that Beals is now a
				secretary for the Washington Society for the Prevention and Relief of Tuberculosis in Seattle, Washington.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li><strong>1907-1908</strong>
    :Dr. Ella Isabel Harris and Alberta MacDonnell are teaching English courses. MacDonnell is listed on the faculty page as an Assistant.&nbsp;
    </li>

				Department with Wilson. Davidson Graduated from Emerson College of Oratory, Boston.
				She is a graduate of the Washington State Normal School. Harris retired after 15
				years at the Normal School. Things really start to change now. Major changes occur
