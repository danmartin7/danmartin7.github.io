							<h3 id="What is multimodality">What Is Multimodality?</h3>
							<p>By Dan Martin</p>
							<p>Multimodality is not a new term or idea. Many people use multimedia and multimodal interchangably despite the
								differences between the terms. Multimedia is a term more closely associated with the production and delivery of media
								and multimodality is a term more closely associated with composing with media and creating a multimedia product. A more
								important distinction to make is between the terms <i>mode</i> and <i>medium</i>. These two terms are different. A mode
								is a sound, image, animation, or text (writing) while a medium is something that contains different modes and combinations of modes 
								like a TV, radio, computer, or smartphone. People use different modes and mediums to design a variety
								of messages on a variety of platforms for different purposes and goals. Tracey Bowen and Carl Whithaus
								(2013) define multimodal composing as “the conscious manipulation of the
						interaction among various sensory experiences—visual, verbal, tactical, aural—used in the processes or producing
						and reading texts” (7). This definition highlights the rhetorical, semiotic, and intertextual nature of multimodal
						and digital forms that require critical multimodal literacies to interpret. </p>

<p>Learning how to read multimodal and digital text and forms requires learning new conventions and standards for reading 
combinations of image, text, and sound. Multimodal projects ask readers "to perform, or rather, produce
 [the author’s] argument for themselves” (Ball, 419). Multimodal texts allow audiences numerous ways to generate meaning because 
	“Meaning is made through the reader’s choice and arrangement of multimodal fragments” (Ball 420). 
	Multimodal and digital forms provide users an
opportunity to forge their own experience with multimodal content</p>
							
<ul>
<li>A multimodal form is a multidimensional space in which a multitude of semiotic materials, none of them original,
	blend and clash within various mediums.</li>
<li>The multimodal form is a combination of semiotic materials and modes (images, sounds, text).</li>
<li>A multimodal rhetor’s only power is to mix modes and mediums.</li>
<li>The multimodal form is a network of signs.</li>
<li>Multimodal forms are disentangled and not deciphered.</li>
  <li>To have an author of a multimodal form is to limit that form (146-47).</li>
</ul>

<p>We can use these six semiotic principles of multimodal texts as a method for questioning the
	multidimensional spaces where authorless networks of semiotic materials must be disentangled.
	This further exposes the original contexts for each and every type of text involved in formulating a
	a new text. When approaching the reading of online
	material and social media, we should remember that the information has been pieced together from other
	 materials, and that each one of those materials has an original context.</p>
