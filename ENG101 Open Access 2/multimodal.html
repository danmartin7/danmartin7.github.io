							<h1>Multimodality</h1>
<p>On this webpage, you will learn how to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#">What is multimodality?</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Why is multimodal composition important?</a></li>
<li><a href="#"></a>What is semiotics?</li>
	</ol>

							<p>Multimodality is not a new term or idea. Many people use multimedia and multimodal interchangably despite the
								differences between the terms. Multimedia is a term more closely associated with the production and delivery of media
								and multimodality is a term more closely associated with composing and creating the multimedia product. The more
								important distinction to make is between the terms mode and medium. These two terms are in fact different. A mode
								is a sound, image, animation, or text while a medium is something that contains modes like a TV, radio, computer,
								smartphone, etc. In this course, we are interested in how people use different modes and mediums to design a variety
								of messages on a variety of platforms for a variety of different purposes and goals.Tracey Bowen and Carl Whithaus
								(2013) define multimodal composing as “the conscious manipulation of the
						interaction among various sensory experiences—visual, verbal, tactical, aural—used in the processes or producing
						and reading texts” (7). This definition highlights the rhetorical, semiotic, and intertextual nature of multimodal
						and digital forms that require critical multimodal literacies to interpret. Cordova (2013) also argues that
						multiliteracies are “deeply concerned with the hybridity of culture and the intertextuality of semiotic symbolic
						flows” (150) of content and information.</p>

<p>Using print literacy conventions to read multimodal and digital text hinders the user's ability to account for
the decontextualization of various intertext. Print conventions and standards for reading do not apply to multimodal
forms that combine image, text, and sound to create remixed forms. Cheryl Ball asserts that in a multimodal project or
 digital text “The multiple modes that the designer presents to readers encourages them to perform, or rather, produce
 [the author’s] argument for themselves” (419). Multimodal forms ask readers to construct meaning from the semiotic
 materials provided. Fake news, delivered via social media in a multimodal form, asks users to produce their own meaning
 for the news. </p>

<p>Multimodal texts allow for more ways to generate meaning because the combining of forms opens more entry-ways into that
text for a user. “Meaning is made through the reader’s choice and arrangement of multimodal fragments” (Ball 420).
This is particularly relevant when scrolling down a news feed and reading headlines, comments, likes, images, and sounds.
These combinations of modes and forms impact how we read each form. Multimodal and digital forms provide users an
opportunity to forge their own experience with the content and an opportunity to control how they generate meaning to
some extent; however, we need to teach students how to generate valuable meanings from multimodal and digital forms.
These mediums and forms can be as useful or as useless as the strategies we employ to select and design with them.
Teaching students multimodal literacies and digital rhetoric is the best means of combating misinformation and fake
news in digital writing environments. The following six truths from Barthes have been updated to accommodate multimodal forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>A multimodal form is a multidimensional space in which a multitude of semiotic materials, none of them original,
	blend and clash within various mediums.</li>
<li>The multimodal form is a combination of semiotic materials and modes (images, sounds, text).</li>
<li>A multimodal rhetor’s only power is to mix modes and mediums.</li>
<li>The multimodal form is a network of signs.</li>
<li>Multimodal forms are disentangled and not deciphered.</li>
  <li>To have an author of a multimodal form is to limit that form (146-47).</li>
</ul>

<p>We can use these six semiotic principles of multimodal texts as a method for questioning the
	multidimensional spaces where authorless networks of semiotic materials must be disentangled.
	This further exposes the original contexts for each and every type of text involved in formulating a
	multimodal or digital piece of fake news or misinformation. When approaching the reading of online
	material and social media, we should remember that the information has been pieced together from other
	 materials, and that each one of those materials has an original context.</p>
