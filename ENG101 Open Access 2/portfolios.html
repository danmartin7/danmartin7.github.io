              <p>Portfolios give you and your writing more agency, and they encourage you to reflect on your learning
                and revise your writing and ideas. Portfolios demonstrate the relationship between your process and the product,
                and they allow you to examine and analyze your writing processes. Portfolios are built on the following core principles: </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Collecting </li>
		<li>Selecting</li>
                    <li>Reflecting</li>
                    <li>Revising</li>
                    <li>Evaluating</li>
                    </ul>
							
                  <p> Numerous educators and writing instructors have expressed a deep affinity for portfolios and portfolio pedagogy. 
			  In “The Use of ePortfolios in Evaluating the Curriculum and Student Learning,” Dale Fitch, Melissa Peet,
                   Beth Glover Reed, and Richard Tolman explain that portfolios prompt students to reflect on
                   their experiences and ideas and they allow students to clarify their goals (p. 39).
			  In “Establishing Portfolio Evaluation,” Anne Gere, Hannah Dickinson, Melinda McBee Orzulak, and Stephanie Moody contend
that portfolios give students the chance to reflect on their work and
improve metacognitive abilities. In “Assessing, Grading, Testing, and Teaching Writing” Brian Huot
argues that the process of compiling a portfolio
allows students to practice assessing their own writing (p. 72). In “Portfolios in Progress: Reevaluating Assessment,”
Sarah D. Spence and Billie Theriot note that portfolios enable students “to begin the process of self-determination,
independence, and responsibility” (p. 34). In “Revising Our Practices: How Portfolios Help Teachers Learn,”
Irwin Weiser describes how portfolios allow students to make more of
 their own decisions during the collection, reflection, selection, and revision processes (p. 296).
 Furthermore, because portfolios are evaluated as a
complete collection, they can help identify and emphasize the importance of growth in learning
and help students see “each piece as part of an ongoing
process...contributing to the student’s development, not as a discrete marker of it” (Wesier, p. 296).
			  In “Reflection, Revision, and Assessment in First-Year Composition ePortfolios”
                  Christy Desmet, Deborah Church Miller, June Griffin, Ron Balthazor, and Robert E. Cummings
                  contend that portfolios do four specific things: 
		
		<ol>
			<li>They "increase the writer’s agency in assessment,” since the writer persuades their audience through a reflective introduction (p. 19). </li>
			<li>Second, portfolios encourage students to reflect on their revision process and use it to revise papers that may otherwise remain untouched (19). </li>
			<li>Third, portfolios establish “an explicit relationship between process and product” (19). </li>
			<li>Finally, portfolios help students learn about audience (p. 19).</li>
							</ol>
		<p>Take a few minutes to think about these four characteristics of a portfolio and discuss them with your instructor and classmates to learn more about
			the value of portfolios and how they are used in this course as a learning tool.</p>

<p>Google sites makes it really easy to add videos and various texts from other platforms.
Students can add collaborative works using google slides or docs (this makes it social).
It’s very accessible; all you need is a google account
Students can have multiple pages for videos, essays, and reflections.
If a student picks a picture as a heading, Google will automatically make a color scheme to fit the rest of the portfolio.
Everyone can access each other’s eportfolios as you create personalized web addresses for people to search,
or you can specifically invite someone to view your portfolio (similar process to viewing a google doc).
Students can unpublish your eportfolio at any time.
Students can select a preview option for a computer, tablet, or phone to see what their portfolio would look
each device and medium. </p>


<<h4>How to Make an ePortfolio Using Wix</h4>
<iframe width="460" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuMhHBu4AfE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Wix is a free website creator?
Students specify the template based on what they want it for: a school assignment or a job or college application.
Students can view the template before making a decision.
There is a bigger outlet for creativity as Wix lets people choose colors, designs, music, art, and motion throughout the website.
Students can add images, links, videos, songs, and social media buttons that link to other pages, blogs, online stores.
The website will be made public.</p>


<h4>How to Make an ePortfolio Using Twine </h4>
<iframe width="460" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g7VYL8xqJnQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Students who are familiar with computer science, gaming, and programming may find this tool more interesting
This platform will help you see nonlinear connections to various componenets of your portfolio.
You do not need to know how to code to use Twine.
Using the off-line version is best because when you use Twine online it is linked to your browser history, which means
if you clear your browser history, the project will disappear.
Twine is compatible with several different computers, phones, and tablets because of its universal CSS coding system.
To share, a student needs to download the most recent version of their Twine project. The project downloads
to an html file on their device. When clicked, the project opens up into its own web browser.
Choosing a “story format” will determine what coding and changes a student will need to make to the project.
To change the font, color, or any other stylistic element, a student has to use CSS.
The possibilities are endless for customization.
Students can add images and music that they created themselves or that they find on the internet.
Depending on your level of programming and markup knowledge, Twine can require quite a bit of work to design a project.</p>
